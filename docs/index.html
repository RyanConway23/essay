			<p id="intro-text" >Erik Spiekermann is a well-known and respected artist in the design industry he is known for some of his work with Mozilla, Red Bull, Volkswagen and The German ‘Deutsche Bahn’. His work is highly influential and inspiring to other artists and I will explore some of the designs and some of the typefaces he has created in his lifetime. Hopefully this will help to answer the question of why Erik Spiekermann had a huge impact on Modern Design and how we design today.</p>

	<p id="career-text">In 1988 Spiekermann and his wife Joan Spiekermann created ‘FontShop’, This was a huge step for design as it was the first mail order shop for digital fonts. Spiekermann received a professorship at the Academy of Arts in Bremen, He also received an honorary doctorate for his input to Graphic Design at the Art Center College of Design in Pasadena, USA. He is also a member of the German Design Council.
In 2001 Spiekermann re-designed ‘The Economist’ magazine through the Edenspiekermann Design Agency he changed the typefaces to suit a more pleasant reading experience and they adjusted the brands colour schemes that would be used throughout the company.

				<p id="awards-text">In 2006 Spiekermann received a gold award at the German Federal Design Prize thus being the biggest award that can be presented. The judges declared Spiekermann’s typeface as a masterpiece as it spreads the German culture while having an updated and refined brand image which helps customers to intake information. 2001 showed a new chapter in Spiekermann’s career as he resigned from MetaDesign and founded another design agency ‘SpikermannPartners’. Some of their clients are Red Bull, Bosch, Cisco Systems and Nokia. Spiekermann merged with Eden Design in Amsterdam in 2009 to become ‘EdenSpiekermann’ which it is still currently known as. </p>

<p id="typeface-text" >In 2013 Spikermann created Fira Sans for the ‘Mozilla Firefox OS’ he got help from other designers such as Ralph du Carrois and Anja Meiners. Fira Sans can be linked to the Meta Typeface which was also designed by Spiekermann back in the 1980’s which is used by the ‘Mozilla Foundation’. Fira Sans has now become an open source project so others can develop the family even further with more weights and styles.</p>

        <div class="flex-item">
          <p id="work-text">I like these chosen typefaces as they all have unique properties in their design. In Berliner Grotesk BQ it has a very family friendly appeal and gives off a fun and happy vibe. The Letters themselves are quite thick but it matches the style of the typeface as it would not be as effective if it was thin.
    The font ‘FF Meta’ is a great Sans-serif font as it has a German feel to the design but is still very modern and well designed. This font would look good on Branding as it has a very noticeable presence on the page and works well on the canvas.
    The typeface ITC Officina Serif is my least favorite font out of the four as it seems too digital in my opinion. They typeface is still very well designed and created but I can’t see it being as effective as some of the other typefaces he has created. I believe the uses for this font are limited as a result of its style.
    ITC Officina Sans is a better alternate typeface compared to the serif version; it has a great presence to a viewer. It has great design and thought in the letter forms. It is very current in its styling as it fits look for today’s design world.

        <p id="airport-text">This signage was designed by Spiekermann as a temporary replacement as there was fire in Düsseldorf Airport, the signage was then later made permanent and is still used to this day. The font face is very effective in its purpose its clear and precise. I Believe the type face serves its purpose well as its nicely spaced so even passengers who are in a rush can easily stop and have a quick look without having to stop for a long time to try figure out what the sign is saying. The typeface is great as a sans-serif style and I believe could be used effectively for other purposes such as posters and other mediums.</p>

      <p id="work-text">FF Unit is a powerful and impactful sans typeface, the typeface has 28 different styles and weights which are easily implemented into different mediums. In my opinion I feel this typeface has a very active and energetic vibe and would work well on promotional material for fitness orientated companies. This diverse typeface is very strong and powerful particularly in the heavier weights, whereas the slimmer weights keep to a very sleek and modern vibe. This typeface was co-created by Christian Schwartz alongside Spiekermann.</p>

    <p id="airport-text">I personally enjoy this typeface as it shows a lot of character and uniqueness in its style, I personally get a very European feel from the typeface with the way it flows. The letter forms seem to be made slightly taller compared to the width of the letters, this makes it look slightly unproportionate to the scale but I feel it actually benefits the typeface by making it more visually appealing to the eye. This font face would work well on multiple mediums such as promotional material such as posters and billboards but would also be useful for branding. This font was co-created by ole schäfer who is also another German Typographer.</p>

	<div class="flex-container">
			<h1 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h1>
		<div class="flex-item">
			<p id="conclusion-text"> Spiekermann who is currently 72 has officially retired from designing but his work and typefaces still play a role in society today. His approach to design is distinguishable and will continue to inspire others to follow in his footsteps. Spiekermann has left behind a legacy with his design agency ‘EdenSpiekermann’ which is globally available in Germany, America and the Netherlands and this allows companies and brands to get their own small touch of spiekermann’s style and passion in their work even though that he has retired. When it comes to his work with the German ‘Deutsche Bahn’ people have become familiarized with the new brands rebrand. His work with the ‘Fira Sans’ typeface is impactful and important to modern design as it has opened opportunity’s for other designers to contribute to the work of Spiekermann by making it a Open Source Project so more variations of his original typeface family can be added to, This is why I believe Erik Spiekermann had such an impact on Modern Design.</p>
